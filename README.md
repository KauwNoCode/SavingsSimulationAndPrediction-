## Predictive Modeling — S&P 500 Monthly Trend Classification

### Problem Statement

The core question of this project is: **can macroeconomic and market variables observed at month *t* predict whether the S&P 500 will rise or fall at month *t+1*?**

All models use a chronological 80/20 train/test split and all features are lagged by 1 month to avoid look-ahead bias.

---

### Model Results

#### Multiple Linear Regression (`RegressionModels/`)
Predicts the continuous monthly return, converted to a binary signal (positive = up, negative = down).

| Metric | Train | Test |
|--------|-------|------|
| R² | 0.330 | -2.136 |
| Adjusted R² | 0.248 | — |
| RMSE | — | 6.514 |
| MAE | — | 4.217 |
| F-statistic | 4.002 (p < 0.001) | — |
| Residual Std. Error | 3.218 (195 df) | — |
| AIC | 515.66 | — |

**Conclusion:** The model captures some signal on the training set (R²=0.33) but completely fails to generalise — a test R² of -2.14 means it performs far worse than simply predicting the mean return. The high RMSE (6.51) relative to average monthly returns confirms that linear regression is not suited for this noisy classification problem.

---

#### Logistic Regression — Simple (`RegressionModels/`)
Direct binary classification (up/down) trained on lagged macro variables.

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 69.6% |
| AUC | 0.478 |
| Sensitivity | 95.0% |
| Specificity | 6.25% |

**Conclusion:** The model almost always predicts "up", which inflates accuracy given the market rises ~65% of months. The near-zero specificity and AUC below 0.5 confirm it has no real discriminatory power.

---

#### Logistic Regression — Optimised (`RegressionModels/`)
Adds class weighting and optimal threshold selection via ROC curve.

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 57.1% |
| AUC | 0.472 |
| Sensitivity | 60.0% |
| Specificity | 50.0% |

**Conclusion:** Rebalancing improved specificity significantly (6.25% → 50%), meaning the model now identifies down months more reliably. However the AUC remains below 0.5, indicating the signal is still very weak overall.

---

#### Random Forest (`RFandXGB/`)
Ensemble of 500 decision trees trained on 30+ macro, momentum, rate and sentiment features.

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| OOB Accuracy | 62.4% |
| OOB Error | 37.6% |
| AUC | 0.460 |
| Accuracy | 54.5% |
| Sensitivity | 58.5% |
| Specificity | 47.1% |
| F1 Score | 0.628 |

**Conclusion:** The Random Forest shows the most balanced profile between sensitivity and specificity. However, the AUC below 0.5 indicates the model does not reliably discriminate between up and down months on the test set. The signal extracted from macro variables alone remains insufficient.

---

#### Gradient Boosting — XGBoost (`RFandXGB/`)
Optimised via randomised search (60 combinations) on a time-series cross-validation.

Best hyperparameters found:
- `n_estimators`: 202 — `max_depth`: 6 — `learning_rate`: 0.079
- `colsample_bytree`: 0.651 — `gamma`: 0.261 — `subsample`: 0.726 — `min_child_weight`: 5

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| AUC | 0.483 |
| Accuracy | 62.6% |
| Sensitivity | 93.9% |
| Specificity | 2.94% |
| F1 Score | 0.767 |

**Conclusion:** XGBoost suffers from the same bias as the simple logistic regression — it predicts "up" almost systematically (specificity of 2.94%). The high accuracy is misleading and purely driven by the class imbalance (~65% up months). The near-zero specificity makes this model unusable as a real trading signal.

### Overall Comparison

| Model | AUC | Accuracy | Sensitivity | Specificity | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multiple Regression | — | — | — | — | — |
| Logistic Simple | 0.478 | 69.6% | 95.0% | 6.25% | — |
| Logistic Optimised | 0.472 | 57.1% | 60.0% | 50.0% | — |
| Random Forest | 0.460 | 54.5% | 58.5% | 47.1% | 0.628 |
| XGBoost | 0.483 | 62.6% | 93.9% | 2.94% | 0.767 |

### Next Month Signal (January 2026 data)

| Model | P(Up) | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | 63.4% | LONG ↑ |
| XGBoost | 67.2% | LONG ↑ |

### Key Takeaway

All models struggle to beat a random baseline (AUC ≈ 0.5). This is consistent with the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** — monthly S&P 500 direction is extremely difficult to predict from public macroeconomic data alone. The best result in terms of balance between sensitivity and specificity is the **Optimised Logistic Regression**, while the **Random Forest** offers the most stable profile across all metrics.

## Data Description

- **`DataCsv/`** — CSV files for SNP500, CAC40, Gold, BTC and macro variables
- **`PyData/yfinanceDATA.py`** — Monthly OHLCV data from first available date to today for each asset
- **`PyData/RecupDataSNP500.py`** — Extended S&P 500 dataset including macro and sentiment variables via FRED API

## Required Libraries

### Python
yfinance
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
scipy
fredapi

### R
```r
install.packages(c(
  "ggplot2", "factoextra", "FactoMineR", "corrplot",
  "caret", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "scales", "reshape2",
  "ROSE", "randomForest", "ranger", "xgboost",
  "pROC", "zoo", "doParallel"
))
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation
```bash
cd PyData/
python yfinanceDATA.py         # Fetch asset price data
python RecupDataSNP500.py      # Fetch S&P 500 macro dataset
```

### 2. Savings Simulation (R)
Open `Epargne/Epargne.Rmd` in RStudio and knit to visualize asset evolution.

### 3. Regression Models (R)
Open `RegressionModels/ModelMultipleReg.Rmd` in RStudio and knit to run multiple and logistic regression models.

### 4. Random Forest & XGBoost (R)
Open `RFandXGB/ForXgbModel.Rmd` in RStudio and knit to run tree-based models.

### 5. Random Forest & XGBoost (Python) — ⚠️ Computationally Intensive
The Python pipeline can also be run locally in RStudio via the `.R` scripts, but due to the volume of computations involved, **running on Google Colab is strongly recommended**:

- **Random Forest:** 12 hyperparameter combinations × time-series cross-validation, each fitting a forest of **500 trees** across **30+ features** → ~6,000 trees trained in total
- **XGBoost:** **60 randomised configurations** evaluated via time-series CV, each boosting up to **300 sequential trees** → up to **18,000 boosting rounds** in total

This represents several thousand model fits and can take 10–30 minutes on a standard machine. Google Colab's free GPU/CPU runtime handles this significantly faster.
```bash
# Run locally
cd RFandXGB/
python snp500_modeles_predictifs.py

# Or open directly in Google Colab:
# Upload snp500_modeles_predictifs.py + snp500_enrichi.csv and run
```

### 6. Interactive Visualization
Open `HtmlWS/SimulationImmob.html` or `HtmlWS/PortfolioSimulator.html` directly in any browser — no server required.
